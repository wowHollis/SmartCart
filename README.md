# Smart Cart

This project is for study Arduino code can control sensors and motors. This can be a good usecase of Pixy camera module recognizing object and following feature, and also detect obstacle by sonar sensor, DC motor driver as well.


## Motivation

We had a deep discussion about what is good mock-up sample using visual recognition and following feature, and it get through the Smart Cart. Smart Cart is a moving robot can follow a registered object with avoiding obstacles, it can be used for shopping cart, traveler's suitcase and moving backpack.


## Installation

All is running on Arduino Uno, but needs Pixy, sonar sensor and DC motor & driver.

This project use SimplerTimer Library for Arduion, so you should follow the installation instruction below.

1. Copy SimpleTimer folder in lib into your Arduino/libraries folder.
2. Launch or restart the Arduino IDE to let it detect the new library.
